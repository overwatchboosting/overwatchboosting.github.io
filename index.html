				<div class="panel-body text-size-13 text-justify">
					<p>Overwatch competitive boosting is for those who would like to quickly and painlessly raise their skill rating (SR) in the Overwatch competitive format. Whether you want to escape the frustrating climb, earn better end of season rewards, or rank up so you can group up with higher ranked friends, we can help.</p>
					
					<p>We are a group of highly ranked North American Overwatch players who started off by boosting friends and friends of friends as favors during Season 2. All of our current boosters (the ones playing) are Season 3 grandmasters as well as top 1% as ranked by <a href="http://masteroverwatch.com/">Master Overwatch</a>.</p>

				<div class="panel-body text-size-13 text-justify">
					<h2 class="bignoodle">Solo Boosts</h2>
					<p>Solo boosts are the cheapest and are how boosting is traditionally done. A solo boost involves a high skill player playing directly on your account. For account security and peace of mind, you should set a temporary password on your Battle.net account. Additionally, if you have a smart phone we recommend using the <a href=” https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.bma”>Battle.net mobile authenticator</a>.</p>
					<h2 class="bignoodle">Group Boosts</h2>
					<p>Group boosts involve one or more of us playing on alternate accounts with a similar SR as yours and grouping up with you to play Competitive. While we’re usually silent, if you like we can provide limited coaching and give you tips and pointers on your gameplay as well as general advice.</p>

				<div class="panel-heading"><h1 class="bignoodle">Frequently Asked Questions</h1></div>
				<div class="panel-body text-size-13 text-justify">
				
					<h3 class="bignoodle">Q: Why are solo boosts so much cheaper than group boosts?</h3>
					<p>Other than the time spent playing, the most significant cost of performing boosts is preparing any alternate accounts we use. It takes a lot of time on our part to bring these accounts to the right rank before and after using them for group boosts. Since this isn’t necessary for solo boosts we’re able to offer them for much less.
</p>
					<h3 class="bignoodle">Q: How long does it normally take?</h3>
					<p>Completing any open boosts we have is our #1 priority when we’re online. Solo boosts are exceptionally fast and can usually be completed within 1-2 days, regardless of starting and ending SR (our record is a 2000 SR solo boost done in less than a day). Group boosts are dependent on your availability more than anything, playing non-stop will result in a time similar to solo boosts.</p>
					
					<h3 class="bignoodle">Q: Will you play specific heroes?</h3>
					<p>This depends on the type and SR range of the boost and is usually not offered. If this is important to you feel free to contact us so we can possibly work something out.</p>
					
					<h3 class="bignoodle">Q: Do you offer coaching?</h3>
					<p>While we try to offer helpful advice and tips during group boosts, at this time we are not willing to provide dedicated coaching. Instead, we recommend using a discord group such as <a href ="https://discord.gg/VxYhChh">https://discord.gg/VxYhChh</a> in order to find a coach.</p>
